  planning modules.

## Layer Role

The planning layer is responsible for:

- generating paths or trajectories from goals, maps, and robot state
- local obstacle avoidance
- motion feasibility and trajectory shaping
- generating motion plans for manipulation tasks such as grasp execution

It is not responsible for:

- raw hardware access
- pure localization estimation
- waypoint logic, behavior trees, or task dispatch

## Recommended Directory Name

```text
planning/
```

Modules such as `ego-planner-swarm`, `venom_teb_controller`, custom Nav2 controllers, and MoveIt grasp planning live here.

## Current Status

The main workspace now contains a committed `planning/` directory. `planning/navigation/` already contains `ego-planner-swarm` and `venom_teb_controller`, while `planning/manipulation/` remains the entry point for arm-side motion planning.

## Current Layout Pattern

```text
planning/
├── navigation/
│   ├── ego-planner-swarm/
│   └── venom_teb_controller/
└── manipulation/
    └── .gitkeep
```

`planning/manipulation/` is currently the target location for future arm-side MoveIt / grasp-planning packages. No concrete package has landed there yet.

## Current Modules And Reserved Entrypoints

- `ego-planner-swarm`
- `venom_teb_controller`
- `planning/manipulation/`

## Boundary With The Mission Layer

- `planning/` answers “how to move”
- `mission/` answers “when to dispatch goals, switch tasks, and advance flows”

Those concerns should stay separated.
